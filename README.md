# About

A community for self-motivated developers working on iOS, Android, and Windows mobile platforms.

# Rules

1. Must be working on a project or creation.
2. No goofing off. Time is very limited.
3. Be courteous when giving constructive criticism.
5. Github commits are how we track attendance.
   Commit the scope of work that was done at the end of the meet.

# Workflow

1. 30 Minutes  Demos/HowTo's/Talks/tutorials on general interest subjects
2. 05 Minutes  Task Assignments/Updating Logs
3. 25 Minutes  1st Work Session
4. 05 Minutes  Diversion/Break
5. 25 Minutes  2nd Work Session
6. 05 Minutes  Break
7. 25 Minutes  3rd Work Session
8. 30 Minutes  Group Updates / Questions

# Good Habits

Commit often. Even though it is mandatory to commit once during our meet, we encourage developers to commit often and at least once a day. Keep your project going and don't break the chain! 
Don't hesitate to ask for help. We reserve the last 15 minutes of our meet to crowd source any problems anyone may be having. Ask questions and answer questions!

# Expectations

We will not provide a lecture on how to use any tools for developing on mobile platform.
We will provide basic setup to get you going.
The take away at the end of the semester is to have a project completed that you can list as an accomplishment.
Software versioning (Git) and time management will be discussed (SCRUM).
MVC design architecture will be reviewed.
No group project will be developed to completion.  This is to learn, not to immediately think about monetization.


## Scope of Projects

Projects will start off as stand alone, meaning no user input will be necessary.
We will progress to projects that involve user input.
After, we will introduce projects that involve use of a database.
Those projects can retrieve data from either an existing repository, using their API,  or an existing database stored locally that may require additional development.
We will make use of the platforms API as much as possible.

# Additional Notes

Stand alone app that does not require any outside interaction.
Most simplest form of app.

Next app would have a database.

You would use built in databases.
Understand basic CRUD operations.
Object modeling.

Tangential would be obtaining data from a server.

Think of something that already exists and add a new feature.
